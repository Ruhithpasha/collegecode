# 2. Convert text into numeric features
vectorizer = CountVectorizer()
"""
 creates an object called vectorizer that will convert text into numbers (specifically, a bag-of-words model).
 It takes all the unique words in your dataset and builds a vocabulary.
 Each word becomes a feature (like a column in a spreadsheet).
 ðŸ”¤ Think of it as preparing a list of all words found in the emails.
"""

X = vectorizer.fit_transform(emails)
"""
fit â†’ Learns all the words (vocabulary) from your email data.
transform â†’ Converts each email into a numeric vector showing how many times each word appears.
The result X is a matrix of word counts:
Rows = individual emails
Columns = unique words
Values = how many times each word appears in that email
"""
